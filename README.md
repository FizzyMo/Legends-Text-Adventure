  ## Project Overview
  ### What the Project Aims to Achieve
This interactive story transports players into the world of **Xayah** and **Rakan**, two legendary characters from the League of Legends universe. Players step into the role of Xayah, embarking on a critical mission to rescue her soulmate, Rakan, from human captors.
The narrative is designed as a **Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)** experience, where each decision fundamentally alters the story's trajectory. Unlike traditional linear narratives, this game empowers players to shape the protagonist's journey through strategic choices, leading to multiple potential outcomes and endings.
